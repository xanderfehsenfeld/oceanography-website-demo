        ### Puget Sound Drifter Tracks

        The map plot shows tracks from simulated surface drifter tracks over three days from the most recent LiveOcean daily forecast. At the start time you can see the initial drifter release locations as blue dots.

        Using the "Time Slider" you can see where each particle goes in time. If you click and drag across a region of the map with some drifters in it they will turn red. They will stay red when you use the Time Slider. By selecting different groups of particles at different times you can explore questions such as: Where do all the particles from one place go? or Where did all the particles that ended up in some place come from?
