title: How Tides Work in Puget Sound
description: Tides in the Pacific Northwest are large, and have complex patterns that can be hard to understand. Here we look at some of these patterns and the reasons for them.

## The plots to the right or below show the tide height at Seattle over three different time periods:

## These have many of the features we would like to explain:

**One Day**

-   [Why are there two tidal cycles in a day?](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/tides_background.html#semidiurnal)
-   [Why are the two low waters in a day so different from each other?](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/tides_background.html#diurnal)

**One Month**

-   [Why are there times of the month with much larger tidal range?](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/tides_background.html#spring-neap)
-   [Why are there times in the month when the two low waters are about equal?](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/tides_background.html#declination)

**One Year**

-   [What causes changes in the tide over the course of a year?](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/tides_background.html#annual)

**Long-term Variation of the Tides**

-   [What about sea level rise?](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/tides_background.html#long-term)

**Spatial Patterns of Tides**

-   [Are the tides in Seattle the same as those on the Washington coast?](https://faculty.washington.edu/pmacc/LO/tides_background.html#spatial)

## Why are there two tides a day? 

Over one day there are about two tidal cycles, meaning two high waters and two low waters. Tides are caused by small perturbations to gravity due to the sun and moon. The sun is highest in the sky once a day, and the moon is on almost the same schedule, being highest in the sky once every 24 hours and 50 minutes. So why are there two tidal cycles? The reason is that the forcing from either sun or moon peaks twice a day.

Tides are forced by tiny variations of gravity due to the moon and sun. Even though it is much smaller, the moon's influence is about twice as big as the sun's, because it is closer. The physics is the same in both cases so we can just look at one to find out what is going on.
