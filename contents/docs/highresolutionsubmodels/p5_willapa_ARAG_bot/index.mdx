        ### This is a movie made from the most recent LiveOcean three-day forecast.

        This movie shows the predicted distribution of aragonite saturation state (Ωarag) for bottom waters in two of the three main estuaries on the Washington Coast, Willapa Bay to the south and Grays Harbor to the north. When the aragonite saturation state sis below about 1.5 it is likely that larval oysters will not survive because they will be unable to form shells. During upwelling conditions (winds from the north, typically in the summer) the deep waters entering the coastal estuaries from the shelf can be relatively "corrosive" (low aragonite saturation state) because of natural and anthropogenic processes.

        The movie has a panel at the bottom that shows time. The tide is evident in the twice-a-day variation of the sea surface height. Daytimes are shown as the thick yellow lines on the horizontal axis. Winds are shown by an arrow in the middle of the map, with the scale given by the circle.
