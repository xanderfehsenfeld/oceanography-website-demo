        ### This is a movie made from the most recent LiveOcean three-day forecast.

        This movie shows the predicted distribution of the speed of surface currents in two of the main estuaries on the Washington Coast, Willapa Bay to the south and Grays Harbor to the north.

        The movie has a panel at the bottom that shows time. The tide is evident in the twice-a-day variation of the sea surface height. Daytimes are shown as the thick yellow lines on the horizontal axis. Winds are shown by an arrow in the middle of the map, with the scale given by the circle.
